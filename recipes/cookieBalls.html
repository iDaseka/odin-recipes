        <p>These cookie balls hardly require any cooking at all aside from melting the candy coating, so they're a great last-minute snack.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 pound vanilla-flavored candy coating, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine crushed cookies and cream cheese to form a stiff dough. Roll into balls and dip with a fork in melted candy coating.</li>
            <li>Let rest on waxed paper until set, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
